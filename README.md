# work-clock
Program that keeps track of hours worked, and displays total amount of hours, total break time and estimated pay.

This program will take in the user's name, hourly pay and break times and use information about sessions of work to display the total amount of hours they have worked, the amount of breaks they have taken and their total pay throughout a single day or in a week.

The program will accept this data through text fields in the program, which will be saved to a text file in the project directory. Data and entries can be manually removed by editing the text file and deleting lines that contain the entries or information.
